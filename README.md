Dream League Soccer Match Tracker

# Project Description

  The Dream League Soccer Match Tracker is a data analysis project designed to evaluate and understand personal gameplay performance in Dream League Soccer (DLS). This project focuses on analyzing key gameplay statistics such as total matches played, wins, losses, win percentage, and player contributions during matches. Additionally, it aims to explore how much time has been spent playing the game, identifying patterns in gaming frequency and intensity. By doing so, I do not only understand my in-game performance but also gain insights into my gaming habits and how they allocate my time.

# Why This Project?
  First of all football is a passion for me. I am into this sport since I remember my first moments. I like to play football in real world, watch football matches regardless of who are playing its not even has to be an official football match I can watch ANY football match. I like to speak about the transfers made, teams play, performences, well sequences etc.. In a nutshell, the love I have to this sport is in a different level. In addition to that, I like to play video games and this should not be hart to guess which kind of games I definetely play. Dream League Soccer is a highly competitive mobile football game that I play almost every day. Matches are quick (approximately 5–6 minutes per match), making it ideal for daily gaming. For this reason, I chose to analyze my performance data in this game. 
  
  This project was undertaken to:

**1. Identify Trends:** Analyzing match statistics to uncover winning patterns, peak performance times, and factors affecting gameplay outcomes.

**2. Visualize Time Spent:** Tracking the total time spent playing, identifying peak gaming months, and assessing how gaming fits into daily routines.

**3. Visualize Performance:** Creating interactive and visually compelling representations of gameplay data, such as win rates and match frequencies.

**4. Drive Improvements:** Using data-backed insights to refine gameplay strategies, focus on weaknesses, and replicate successful tactics.

**5. Build Predictive Models:** Leveraging past performance and time data to predict future outcomes, such as win probabilities.

# What This Project Achieves

**1. Performance Analytics:**

  Detailed analysis of team performance metrics over time.
Breakdown of wins and losses to identify trends and anomalies.

**2. Time Tracking and Analysis:**

Estimation of total time spent on the game based on match counts and durations.

**3. Data Visualization:**

Monthly/weekly/daily distribution of matches played and results.
Win percentage trends across time periods etc.

and much more...

# Data Description

This project uses data extracted from the Dream League Soccer Tracker (https://tracker.ftgames.com), a platform that records match history and player performance for Dream League Soccer players. The data is visually presented on the Tracker website and contains detailed match statistics, team performance, and player contributions.

**Data Collected**

**Overall Account Metrics:**
Total Matches Played: The cumulative number of matches played by the user.  

Total Wins and Losses: A breakdown of match results.  

Win Percentage: The success rate, calculated as (Wins / Matches Played) * 100.  

**Match-Level Data:**  
Teams: Names of the user’s team and the opponent.   

Final Score: The scoreline for each match, including goals scored by both teams.  

Outcome: Whether the match ended in a Win, Loss, or Draw.  


**Player Contributions:**  
Goal Scorers: Names of players who scored, along with the time of each goal.
